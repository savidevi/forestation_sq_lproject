# forestation_sql_project

I created a report for the executive team in which I explain my results .

### Report Sections:
The report has five sections that I needed to complete:

Global Situation
Regional Outlook
Country-Level Detail
Recommendations
Appendix: SQL queries used

I found tables of data online dealing with forestation as well as total land area and region groupings, and I’ve brought these tables together into a database that I’d like to query to answer some of the most important questions in preparation for the ForestQuery report.Data is for global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016.

### Steps to Complete:
Create a View called “forestation” by joining all three tables - forest_area, land_area and regions in the workspace.
The forest_area and land_area tables join on both country_code AND year.
The regions table joins these based on only country_code.
In the ‘forestation’ View, include the following:

All of the columns of the origin tables
A new column that provides the percent of the land area that is designated as forest.
Create report based on questions.
